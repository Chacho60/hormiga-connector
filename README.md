## Overview

Typescript connector service for [hormiga-bot](https://github.com/Chacho60/hormiga-bot), it uses the Telegram API to receive messages and RabbitMQ to add those messages to a queue that will be consumed by hormiga-bot. It also uses an outgoing queue to send back messages to the telegram user.

This service is meant to be run alongside hormiga-bot, the .env.example file has values that have a local configuration, so it can be tested when using the docker in hormiga-bot. The only value not provided is the TELEGRAM_TOKEN which youâ€™ll have to get by creating  a new bot.

Also, a live version of the bot hosted in railway, supbase and cloudamqp is available at https://t.me/chacho_ant_bot
